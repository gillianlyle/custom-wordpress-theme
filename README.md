# custom-wordpress-theme
The idea behind this project is to create a custom wordpress theme. This is my first attempt so let's get started. Can't wait! First thing first, let's get my environment set up.

## 1. Setting up the environment
I don't want to spend too much time setting up the server so i've installed [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/), a free local server environment.

I also installed [SQLYog](https://github.com/webyog/sqlyog-community/wiki/Downloads) (alternative to phpMyAdmin).

## 2. Install Wordpress
Downloaded [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/download/), unzipped and placed contents into my project folder. I then ran through the wordpress setup.

## 3. Create a custom theme
Under 'wp-content > themes', I added a new folder called 'customtheme'. I then added in the following php files - index.php, header.php, footer.php and style.css. These files have been split into sections, each section being how the page will be made up.
