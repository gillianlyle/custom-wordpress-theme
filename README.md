# custom-wordpress-theme
The idea behind this project is to create a custom wordpress theme. This is my first attempt so let's get started. Can't wait! First thing first, let's get my environment set up.

## Setting up the environment
I don't want to spend too much time setting up the server so i've installed [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/), a free local server environment.
